This is a pipeline to analyse single-cell RNA sequencing data from Periaqueductal Gray neurons (1) isolated from acute midbrain slices of transgenic mice using visually guided aspiration via patch pipettes and (2) processed using SMART-seq2 (Picelli et al. Nature Protocols 2014). 

This pipeline has been generated after attending the [EMBL-EBI RNA-Sequence Analysis Course](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2019/rna-sequence-analysis) and [attending](https://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/2823386) and following the online course on [Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data](https://github.com/hemberg-lab/scRNA.seq.course) by the [Hemberg Lab](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/hemberg-group). Many other resources have been used, including the [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor book](https://osca.bioconductor.org/) by Robert Amezquita and Stephanie Hicks, the [simpleSingleCell workflow in Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.9/workflows/html/simpleSingleCell.html) maintained by Aaron Lun, the [rnaseqGene workflow](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/html/rnaseqGene.html) maintained by Michael Love, the [RNAseq123 workflow](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/html/RNAseq123.html) maintained by Matthew Ritchie, and the [EGSEA123 workflow](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/html/EGSEA123.html) maintained by Matthew Ritchie.

Below are some code scraps that have been taken out of the pipeline in favour of other preferred alternatives. They most likely require further adaptations before being reincorporated. 

# STEP 2 | Quality Control and pre-processing
## Step 2.5b | Cell cycle phase [OPTIONAL]
It is possible to classify cells into cell cycle phases based on the gene expression data using the function `cyclone` (Sciealdone et al. 2015). This, however, is not super useful in the brain, as many neuronal cell types are expected to lie in the G0 resting phase, which is distinct from the other phases of the cell cycle (Coller et al., 2006). We run it anyway and observe that all the cells are in G1.

Cells are classified as being in G1 phase if the G1 score is above 0.5 and greater than the G2/M score; in G2/M phase if the G2/M score is above 0.5 and greater than the G1 score; and in S phase if neither score is above 0.5.

*See McCarthy et al. F1000Research 2016 for an explanation of this step and the code.*
```{r}
library(scran)
library(AnnotationDbi)
library(org.Mm.eg.db)
set.seed(1991)

mm.pairs <- readRDS(system.file("exdata", "mouse_cycle_markers.rds", package="scran")) 
assignments <- cyclone(PAG_sceset, mm.pairs, gene.names=rowData(PAG_sceset)$ENSEMBL) 
plot(assignments$score$G1, assignments$score$G2M, xlab="G1 score", ylab="G2/M score", pch=16, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1))
```

We could store the cell cycle phases for future use:
```{r}
PAG_sceset$cycle_phase <- assignments$phases
```

# STEP 4 | Modelling technical and biological variability in gene expression and identifying highly variable genes
## PATH "A" to feature selection - trendVar
### Step 4a.4 | Identifying correlated gene pairs with Spearman's rho
Another useful procedure is to identify the HVGs that are highly correlated with one another. This distinguishes between HVGs caused by random noise and those involved in driving systematic differences between subpopulations. Correlations between genes can be quantified by computing Spearman's rho, which accommodates non-linear relationships in the expression values. Gene pairs with significantly large positive or negative values of rho are identified using the `correlatePairs` function. We only apply this function to the set of HVGs, because these genes have large biological components and are more likely to exhibit strong correlations driven by biology. In contrast, calculating correlations for all possible gene pairs would require too much computational time and increase the severity of the multiple testing correction. It may also prioritize uninteresting genes that have strong correlations but low variance, e.g., tightly co-regulated house-keeping genes.
```{r}
# Takes around 1 min
set.seed(1991)
library(scran)

start_time_c1 <- Sys.time()
var.cor <- correlatePairs(PAG_sceset_qc_norm_filt, 
                          subset.row=metadata(PAG_sceset_qc_norm_filt)$hvg_out_no_spikes_filt) 
write.table(file="PAG_correlated_genes.tsv", var.cor, sep="\t", quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE) 
head(var.cor)
end_time_c1 <- Sys.time()
end_time_c1 - start_time_c1
```

The significance of each correlation is determined using a permutation test. For each pair of genes, the null hypothesis is that the expression profiles of two genes are independent. Shuffling the profiles and recalculating the correlation yields a null distribution that is used to obtain a p-value for each observed correlation value (Phipson & Smyth, 2010). Correction for multiple testing across many gene pairs is performed by controlling the FDR at 5%. Correlated gene pairs can be directly used for experimental validation with orthogonal techniques (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting, immunohistochemistry or RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization) to verify that these expression patterns are genuinely present across the cell population.
```{r}
sig.cor <- var.cor$FDR <= 0.05 
summary(sig.cor)
```

The use of `correlatePairs` is primarily intended to identify correlated gene pairs for validation studies. Obviously, non-zero correlations do not provide evidence for a direct regulatory interaction, let alone specify causality. To construct regulatory networks involving many genes, we suggest using dedicated packages such as _[WGCNA](https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/)_.

#### 4a.4.1 | Larger sets of genes
Larger sets of correlated genes are assembled by treating genes as nodes in a graph and each pair of genes with significantly large correlations as an edge. In particular, an undirected graph is constructed using methods in the `RBGL` package. Highly connected subgraphs are then identified and defined as gene sets. This provides a convenient summary of the pairwise correlations between genes.
```{r}
# Takes around 15 min
library(RBGL) 
start_time_c2 <- Sys.time()
g <- ftM2graphNEL(cbind(var.cor$gene1, var.cor$gene2)[sig.cor,], W=NULL, V=NULL, edgemode="undirected")
cl <- highlyConnSG(g)$clusters # Time consuming step
cl <- cl[order(lengths(cl), decreasing=TRUE)] 
head(cl)
end_time_c2 <- Sys.time()
end_time_c2 - start_time_c2
```

Significant correlations provide evidence for substructure in the dataset, i.e., subpopulations of cells with systematic differences in their expression profiles. The number of significantly correlated HVG pairs represents the strength of the substructure. If many pairs were significant, this would indicate that the subpopulations were clearly defined and distinct from one another. 

## PATH "B" to feature selection - M3Drop
__Based on the online course on [Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data](https://github.com/hemberg-lab/scRNA.seq.course) by the [Hemberg Lab](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/hemberg-group).__

We continue using the `PAG_sceset_qc_norm` after normalization. We should thus have a `logcounts` slot in`assays`:
```{r}
# If starting from stored results, load saved filtered dataset from previous Step:
set.seed(1991)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(scater)
library(scran)
library(matrixStats)
library(M3Drop)

PAG_sceset_qc_norm <- readRDS("PAG_sceset_qc_norm.rds") # Contains filtered cells and genes, and normalized data
assayNames(PAG_sceset_qc_norm)
PAG_sceset_qc_norm
```

scRNA-seq is capable of measuring the expression of many thousands of genes in every cell. However, in most situations only a portion of those will show a response to the biological condition of interest, e.g. differences in cell-type, drivers of differentiation, respond to an environmental stimulus. Most genes detected in a scRNA-seq experiment will only be detected at different levels due to technical noise. One consequence of this is that technical noise and batch effects can obscure the biological signal of interest. Thus, it is often advantageous to perform feature selection to remove those genes which only exhibit technical noise from downstream analysis. Not only does this generally increase the signal:noise ratio in the data; it also reduces the computational complexity of analyses, by reducing the total amount of data to be processed.

For scRNA-seq data, we will be focusing on unsupervised methods of feature selection which donâ€™t require any a priori information, such as cell-type labels or biological group, since they may not be available, or may be unreliable, for many experiments. In contrast, differential expression can be considered a form of supervised feature selection since it uses the known biological label of each sample to identify features (i.e. genes) which are expressed at different levels across groups.

__One important thing...__
Before identifying HVGs, consider dropping any Ribosomal, Mitochondrial, ERCC, sex-specific genes (e.g. XIST), transgenes (EYFP, tdTomato, Cre, TSO concatamers) and genes used for transgenic labeling of cells (VGAT and VGluT2) from the dataset before proceeding to downstream analysis, as some of them are not be biologically informative and others have been used to select the cells.
```{r}
dim(PAG_sceset_qc_norm)

is_X_qc_norm <- (rowData(PAG_sceset_qc_norm)$Chromosome == "X") # Find which genes correspond to chromosome X 
is_Y_qc_norm <- (rowData(PAG_sceset_qc_norm)$Chromosome == "Y") # Find which genes correspond to chromosome Y
is_feature_control_qc_norm <- (rowData(PAG_sceset_qc_norm)$is_feature_control) # Find which genes correspond to feature controls (Ribosomal, Mitochondrial, ERCC, transgenes)

filter_genes_qc_norm <- !(is_X_qc_norm | is_Y_qc_norm | is_feature_control_qc_norm)
PAG_sceset_qc_norm <- PAG_sceset_qc_norm[filter_genes_qc_norm, ]
dim(PAG_sceset_qc_norm)
```

Feature selection is performed after QC. `M3Drop` contains two different feature selection methods `M3DropFeatureSelection` which is based on a Michaelis-Menten curve and is designed for full-transcript single-cell RNA-seq data (such as Smart-seq2) and `NBumiFeatureSelectionCombinedDrop` which is based on a negative binomial model and is designed for UMI count data. We will use the former.

`M3Drop` feature selection runs on a normalized (but not log-transformed) expression matrix. This can be extracted from our `SingleCellExperiment` object using the command below. This function is compatible with most single-cell RNA-seq analysis packages including: `scater`, `SingleCellExperiment`, `monocle`, and `Seurat`. It can also convert an existing expression matrix to the correct form (removing undetected genes & normalizing/delogging) if you specify whether the matrix is raw counts, or log transformed. Check the manual for details.
```{r}
#expr_matrix <- M3Drop::M3DropConvertData(PAG_sceset_qc_norm) #
#expr_matrix <- M3DropConvertData(PAG_sceset_qc_norm@assays[["logcounts_raw"]], is.log=TRUE, is.counts=FALSE)
expr_matrix <- M3DropConvertData(PAG_sceset_qc_norm@assays[["counts"]], is.log=FALSE, is.counts=TRUE)
nrow(counts(PAG_sceset_qc_norm)) - nrow(expr_matrix) # check the ConvertData function has dropped undetected genes
```

### Step 4b.1 | Identifying genes vs a Null Model
There are two main approaches to unsupervised feature selection. The first is to identify genes which behave differently from a null model describing just the technical noise expected in the dataset.

If the dataset contains spike-in RNAs they can be used to directly model technical noise. However, measurements of spike-ins may not experience the same technical noise as endogenous transcripts (Svensson et al., 2017). In addition, scRNA-seq experiments often contain only a small number of spike-ins which reduces our confidence in fitted model parameters. We will not use spike-in transcripts beyond QC in our analysis.

#### 4b.1.1 | Highly Variable Genes
The first method proposed to identify features in scRNA-seq datasets was to identify highly variable genes (HVG). HVG assumes that if genes have large differences in expression across cells some of those differences are due to biological difference between the cells rather than technical noise. However, because of the nature of count data, there is a positive relationship between the mean expression of a gene and the variance in the read counts across cells. This relationship must be corrected for to properly identify HVGs.
```{r}
# Plot the relationship between mean expression and variance for all genes in this dataset:
plot(
    rowMeans(expr_matrix), 
    rowVars(expr_matrix), 
    log="xy", 
    pch=16,
    xlab="Mean Expression", 
    ylab="Variance", 
    main=""
)
```

A popular method to correct for the relationship between variance and mean expression was proposed by [Brennecke et al. 2013](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n11/full/nmeth.2645.html). To use the Brennecke method, we first normalize for library size and then calculate the mean and the square coefficient of variation (variation divided by the squared mean expression). A quadratic curve is fit to the relationship between these two variables for the ERCC spike-in, and then a chi-square test is used to find genes significantly above the curve. This method is included in the `M3Drop` package as the `Brennecke_getVariableGenes(counts, spikes)` function. If the dataset does not contain spike-ins we can use the entire dataset to estimate the technical noise.

In the figure below the red curve is the fitted technical noise model and the dashed line is the 95% CI. Pink dots are the genes with significant biological variability after multiple-testing correction.
```{r}
Brennecke_HVG <- M3Drop::BrenneckeGetVariableGenes(expr_matrix,
                                                   fdr = 0.01,
                                                   minBiolDisp = 0.5
                                                   )
```

This function returns a matrix of significant genes as well as their estimated effect size (difference between observed and expected coefficient of variation), and their significance as raw p.values and FDR corrected q.values. For now we will just keep the names of the significant HVG genes.
```{r}
HVG_genes <- Brennecke_HVG$Gene
length(HVG_genes)
```

#### 4b.1.2 | High Dropout Genes
An alternative to finding HVGs is to identify genes with unexpectedly high numbers of zeros. The frequency of zeros, known as the "dropout rate", is very closely related to expression level in scRNASeq data. Zeros are the dominant feature of single-cell RNASeq data, typically accounting for over half of the entries in the final expression matrix. These zeros predominantly result from the failure of mRNAs failing to be reversed transcribed (Andrews and Hemberg, 2016). Reverse transcription is an enzyme reaction thus can be modelled using the Michaelis-Menten equation: Pdropout=1âˆ’S/(K+S) where S is the mRNA concentration in the cell (we will estimate this as average expression) and K is the Michaelis-Menten constant.

Because the Michaelis-Menten equation is a convex non-linear function, genes which are differentially expression across two or more populations of cells in our dataset will be shifted up/right of the Michaelis-Menten model. We use M3Drop to identify significant outliers to the right of the MM curve. We also apply 1% FDR multiple testing correction:
```{r}
M3Drop_genes <- M3DropFeatureSelection(expr_matrix,
                                       mt_method = "fdr",
                                       mt_threshold = 0.01
                                       )
M3Drop_genes <- M3Drop_genes$Gene
length(M3Drop_genes)
```

### Step 4b.2 | Correlated Expression
A completely different approach to feature selection is to use gene-gene correlations. This method is based on the idea that multiple genes will be differentially expressed between different cell-types or cell-states. Genes which are expressed in the same cell-population will be positively correlated with each other where as genes expressed in different cell-populations will be negatively correated with each other. Thus important genes can be identified by the magnitude of their correlation with other genes.

The limitation of this method is that it assumes technical noise is random and independent for each cell, thus shouldn't produce gene-gene correlations, but this assumption is violated by batch effects which are generally systematic between different experimental batches and will produce gene-gene correlations. As a result it is more appropriate to take the top few thousand genes as ranked by gene-gene correlation than consider the significance of the correlations.
```{r}
cor_feat <- M3Drop::corFS(expr_matrix) # Takes a long time
Cor_genes <- names(cor_feat)[1:1500]
```

### Step 4b.3 | PCA loadings
Lastly, another common method for feature selection in scRNASeq data is to use PCA loadings. Genes with high PCA loadings are likely to be highly variable and correlated with many other variable genes, thus may be relevant to the underlying biology. However, as with gene-gene correlations PCA loadings tend to be susceptible to detecting systematic variation due to batch effects; thus it is recommended to plot the PCA results to determine those components corresponding to the biological variation rather than batch effects.
```{r}
# PCA is typically performed on log-transformed expression data
pca <- prcomp(log(expr_matrix + 1) / log(2))

# plot projection
plot(
    pca$rotation[,1], 
    pca$rotation[,2], 
    pch = 16
)
```

```{r}
# calculate loadings for components 1 and 2
score <- rowSums(abs(pca$x[,c(1,2)])) 
names(score) <- rownames(expr_matrix)
score <- score[order(-score)]
PCA_genes <- names(score[1:1500])
```

```{r}
#Consider the top 5 principal components. Which ones appear to be most biologically relevant? How do the top 1,500 features change if you consider the loadings for those components?
plot(
    pca$rotation[,2], 
    pca$rotation[,3], 
    pch = 16
)

plot(
    pca$rotation[,3], 
    pca$rotation[,4], 
    pch = 16
)

# calculate loadings for components 1 and 2
score <- rowSums(abs(pca$x[,c(2, 3, 4)]))
names(score) <- rownames(expr_matrix)
score <- score[order(-score)]
PCA_genes2 = names(score[1:1500])
```

### Step 4b.4 | Comparing Methods
We can check whether the identified features really do represent genes differentially expressed between cell-types in this dataset.
```{r}
M3DropExpressionHeatmap(M3Drop_genes,
                        expr_matrix,
                        cell_labels = PAG_sceset_qc_norm$cell.type
                        )
```

```{r}
M3DropExpressionHeatmap(HVG_genes,
                        expr_matrix,
                        cell_labels = PAG_sceset_qc_norm$cell.type
                        )
```

```{r}
M3DropExpressionHeatmap(Cor_genes,
                        expr_matrix,
                        cell_labels = PAG_sceset_qc_norm$cell.type
                        )
```

```{r}
M3DropExpressionHeatmap(PCA_genes,
                        expr_matrix,
                        cell_labels = PAG_sceset_qc_norm$cell.type
                        )
```

```{r}
M3DropExpressionHeatmap(PCA_genes2,
                        expr_matrix,
                        cell_labels = PAG_sceset_qc_norm$cell.type
                        )
```

We can also consider how consistent each feature selection method is with the others using the Jaccard Index:
```{r}
list_of_features <- list(M3Drop_genes,
                         HVG_genes, 
                         Cor_genes, 
                         PCA_genes, 
                         PCA_genes2
                         )

Out <- matrix(0, 
              ncol = length(list_of_features), 
              nrow = length(list_of_features)
              )

for(i in 1:length(list_of_features) ) {
    for(j in 1:length(list_of_features) ) {
        Out[i,j] <- sum(list_of_features[[i]] %in% list_of_features[[j]])/
            length(unique(c(list_of_features[[i]], list_of_features[[j]])))
     }
}

colnames(Out) <- rownames(Out) <- c("M3Drop", "HVG", "Cor", "PCA", "PCA2")
Out
```

# STEP 7 | Clustering
